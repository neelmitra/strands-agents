# Weather Data MCP Application - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created a comprehensive agentic application for calculating weather data using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This implementation extends the existing Lab4 framework with advanced weather capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Weather MCP Server (`mcp_weather.py`)
A complete MCP server with 7 weather-related tools:

#### Weather Data Retrieval Tools
- **`get_current_weather`**: Retrieves real-time weather conditions using NWS API
- **`get_weather_forecast`**: Gets detailed weather forecasts for up to 7 days  
- **`get_weather_alerts`**: Fetches active weather alerts and warnings

#### Weather Calculation Tools
- **`convert_temperature`**: Converts between Fahrenheit and Celsius
- **`calculate_heat_index`**: Computes apparent temperature with comfort assessments
- **`calculate_wind_chill`**: Calculates wind chill with safety warnings
- **`calculate_average_temperature`**: Performs statistical analysis on temperature data

### 2. Supporting Files

#### Documentation
- **`README_weather.md`**: Comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- **`WEATHER_MCP_SUMMARY.md`**: This implementation summary

#### Testing and Demo Scripts
- **`weather_demo.py`**: Automated demo with predefined queries
- **`test_weather_mcp.py`**: Unit testing for individual MCP tools

#### Configuration Updates
- **`requirements.txt`**: Updated with `requests` library for API calls
- **`mcp-and-tools.ipynb`**: Updated notebook with weather application documentation

## Key Features

### 🌐 Real-Time Weather Data

- No API key required for weather data retrieval
- Handles current conditions, forecasts, and alerts

### 🧮 Advanced Calculations
- Heat index calculation with comfort level assessments
- Wind chill calculation with safety warnings
- Temperature statistics (average, min, max, range)
- Unit conversions between temperature scales

### 🛡️ Safety Features
- Comfort level warnings for heat index conditions
- Frostbite risk assessments for wind chill
- Weather alert notifications
- Error handling for invalid inputs and API failures

### 🤖 Agentic Capabilities
- Natural language interaction with weather tools
- Intelligent tool selection based on user queries
- Contextual responses with practical advice
- Comprehensive system prompts for weather assistance

## Architecture

The application follows the established MCP pattern:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   User Query    │───▶│  Strands Agent   │───▶│  Weather Tools  │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                              │                          │
                              ▼                          ▼
                       ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
                       │   MCP Client     │───▶│   MCP Server    │
                       └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                               ┌─────────────────┐
                                               │   NWS API       │
                                               └─────────────────┘
```

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python3 mcp_weather.py
```

### Demo Mode
```bash
python3 weather_demo.py
```

### Testing Mode
```bash
python3 test_weather_mcp.py
```

## Sample Interactions

### Temperature Conversion
```
User: "Convert 75°F to Celsius"
Agent: "75°F converts to 23.89°C. This is a comfortable room temperature."
```

### Weather Forecast
```
User: "What's the weather like in Seattle?"
Agent: [Uses coordinates 47.6062, -122.3321 to fetch current conditions and provides detailed weather report]
```

### Safety Assessment
```
User: "Calculate heat index for 95°F and 80% humidity"
Agent: "Heat index is 107.6°F - Extreme Caution level. Heat exhaustion and heat cramps are possible with prolonged exposure."
```

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies
- `strands-agents`: Core agent framework
